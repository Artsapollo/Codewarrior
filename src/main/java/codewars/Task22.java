Your task is write a function to calculate the total time required for all the customers to check out!

input
customers: an array of positive integers representing the queue.
Each integer represents a customer, and its value is the amount of time they require to check out.
n: a positive integer, the number of checkout tills.
output
The function should return an integer, the total time required.

    Example:
queueTime([5,3,4], 1)
// should return 12
// because when there it's 1 till, the total time is just the sum of the times

queueTime([10,2,3,3], 2)
// should return 10
// because here n=2 and the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th people in the
// queue finish before the 1st person has finished.

queueTime([2,3,10], 2)
// should return 12
